# Onboarding

## Onboarding Device - Windows

1. If a device is not Brand / OEM then (re)install Windows

    Use specific internal procedure, windows image etc. Keep in mind for secure boot to setup mode. EFI partition to be above 260 MB due to EFI firmware upgrades etc.

1. Make sure that correct BIOS/EFI settings are configured, like:
    1. Enable Secure Boot
    1. Enable Device Guard
    1. Enable Virtualization Technology
    1. Enable Microsoft Pluton (if available)
    1. Specific other hardware vendor settings

1. If company owned device and using Intune, then Enroll device to Windows Autopilot

    On fresh Windows installation and OOBE screen proceed with Shift+F10 to open CMD and get Autopilot info. Need to specify your GroupTag as per organization policy.

    ```powershell
    PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Force
    
    # Option A - Sign-in and add directly to Windows Autopilot devices 
    Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -GroupTag "Default" -Online 
    Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -GroupTag "Shared" -Online 
    
    # Option B - Get info to file
    Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -GroupTag "Default" -OutputFile C:\https://github.com/Nodefusion/NodefusionMSP.UserManual.git 
    Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -GroupTag "Shared" -OutputFile C:\AutopilotHWID.csv 
    ```

    If Option B is used, use import on Intune Admin Center, Devices > Enrollment > Windows Autopilot > Devices with proper account which has Intune Admin permissions. On the upper menu select "Import and then selsect "AutoPilot.csv" from previous step.

1. Windows Out-Of-Box Experience (OOBE = the initial setup process users encounter when first turning on a new Windows computer), go with one scenario:

    * Scenario A - Intune on Company owned device for one primary user (using Windows Autopilot - user driven deployment)
        1. Should not ask for initial language, if it asks, wait and reboot
        1. If Microsoft Entry hybrid - be connected to local network and connectivity to Domain Controller
        1. End-user sign-in with Microsoft Entra account. Can use Microsoft Authenticator, or (preferred) temporary access pass provided by IT admin
        1. Computer will start MDM/Intune enrollment (if hybrid, also local domain join)
    * Scenario B - Intune on Company owned device for shared user scenario (without primary user) (using Windows Autopilot - self-deployment)
        1. Should not ask for initial language, if it asks, wait and reboot
        1. If Microsoft Entry hybrid - be connected to local network and connectivity to Domain Controller
        1. Computer will start MDM/Intune enrollment (if hybrid, also local domain join)
    * Scenario C - Microsoft Entra cloud only (without Intune)
        1. End-user sign-in with Microsoft Entra account. Can use Microsoft Authenticator, or (preferred) temporary access pass provided by IT admin
    * Scenario D - Microsoft Windows Server Active Directory (without Intune)
        1. Sign-in to local Windows Server Active Directory
        1. Move AD computer object to corresponding AD Organization Unit
    * Scenario E - Without Microsoft Entra and without Windows Server Active Directory
        1. Ask for confirmation from project owner, should it be personal Microsoft Account, or Windows local account
        1. If using, hybrid or on-prem, move Windows Server Active Directory - Computer object to corresponding AD Organization Unit

1. After OOBE which includes Intune enrollment and/or domain join, users can do the first login on Windows sign-in prompt:

    * If using hybrid, use Windows Server Active directory username or password
    * If using cloud-only, use Microsoft Entra account. Should use the web-sign option (available in a while after policy is deployed) with sign-in from temporary access pass (from IT admin, preferred) or with Microsoft authenticator

1. After end-user first login, end-user need to setup Windows Hello for Business where use minimum PIN (additional options fingerprint, face recognition etc.). In future logins use username and PIN as minimum.
